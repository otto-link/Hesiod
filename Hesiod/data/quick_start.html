<h1>Hesiod Quick Help</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Hesiod is a free and open-source project (FOSS) that’s still in active development.  
  Some features may be experimental, and the application can occasionally be unstable.  
  Please save your work often (<strong>Ctrl + Alt + S</strong> is handy), and feel free to report bugs or share feedback:

  This quick guide will help you get started with Hesiod.  
  For full details, see the documentation:

</p>

<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Example graphs are available in the <em>data/examples</em> folder: they illustrate small use cases demonstrating specific node functionalities.</li>
  <li>Bootstraps are available in the <em>data/bootstraps</em> folder: they offer minimal starting setups (Quickstart-style) to help you build your own graphs from a functional base.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>
  Hesiod uses a <strong>non-destructive node editor</strong>: instead of permanently changing your data,  
  you build a graph of nodes that describe how to process or transform it.  
  Each node performs an operation, and you can rearrange, disable, or tweak them at any time  
  without altering the original source.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click an empty area of the graph canvas to open the node-creation menu.</li>
  <li>Right-click a node to open its settings menu.</li>
  <li>In the node settings, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to fine-tune slider parameters, or double-click a value to edit it directly.</li>
  <li>Adjust graph settings (including resolution) from the <em>More</em> (<strong>…</strong>) icon in the editor.</li>
  <li>Avoid using the layout manager to edit multiple graphs at once — it can be unstable and overly complex.</li>
  <li>Use the <em>Viewport</em> icon to open a 3D view of the heightmap.</li>
  <li>Add a <em>Preview</em> node and connect its input to the data you want to display.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Export</h2>
<p>
  Use the export nodes in the <em>IO/Files</em> category to save data in your preferred format,  
  as image files or as assets in common 3D formats (e.g., FBX, GLB).
</p>

<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ctrl + B</strong>: Add a comment</li>
  <li><strong>Ctrl + I</strong>: Import a graph
  <li><strong>Ctrl + P</strong>: Automatically arrange the graph layout</li>
  <li><strong>Ctrl + Alt + S</strong>: Save a copy of the current work with a timestamp  
    <br><small>Handy for keeping backups if the app becomes unstable.</small></li>
</ul>

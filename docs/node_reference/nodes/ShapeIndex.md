ShapeIndex Node
===============


ShapeIndex is a measure used to quantify the shape complexity of landforms in an heightmap. It is calculated based on the second derivatives of the elevation surface. The surface index is greater than 0.5 for convex surface and lower than 0.5 for concave surface.

# Parameters

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|Gain|Float|Mid-centered gain transformation applied to the elevation values. This is a non-linear recurve operator centered around the mid elevation (typically 0.5). Increasing the gain pushes values toward the minimum and maximum elevations, creating flatter low/high regions with a steeper transition around the midpoint.|
|Gamma|Float|Standard gamma correction applied to the elevation values. This is a monotonic power-law remapping that shifts emphasis toward low or high elevations, making the overall shape sharper or bulkier without changing its ordering.|
|Invert Output|Bool|Inverts the output values after processing, flipping low and high values across the midrange.|
|Remap Range|Value range|Linearly remaps the output values to a specified target range (default is [0, 1]).|
|Saturation Range|Value range|Modifies the amplitude of elevations by first clamping them to a given interval and then scaling them so that the restricted interval matches the original input range. This enhances contrast in elevation variations while maintaining overall structure.|
|Smoothing Radius|Float|Defines the radius for post-processing smoothing, determining the size of the neighborhood used to average local values and reduce high-frequency detail. A radius of 0 disables smoothing.|
|radius|Float|Filter radius with respect to the domain size.|

# Parameters

|Name|Type|Description|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|center|Vec2Float|No description|
|displacement|Float|No description|
|kw|Float|Base spatial frequencies in the X and Y directions. The frequencies are defined with respect to the entire domain: for example, kw = 2 produces two full oscillations across the domain width (and similarly for the Y direction).|
|Lacunarity|Float|The frequency scaling factor for successive noise octaves. Higher values increase the frequency of each successive octave.|
|Type|Enumeration|No description|
|Octaves|Integer|The number of octaves for fractal noise generation. More octaves add finer details to the terrain.|
|Persistence|Float|The amplitude scaling factor for subsequent noise octaves. Lower values reduce the contribution of higher octaves.|
|Gain|Float|Mid-centered gain transformation applied to the elevation values. This is a non-linear recurve operator centered around the mid elevation (typically 0.5). Increasing the gain pushes values toward the minimum and maximum elevations, creating flatter low/high regions with a steeper transition around the midpoint.|
|Gamma|Float|Standard gamma correction applied to the elevation values. This is a monotonic power-law remapping that shifts emphasis toward low or high elevations, making the overall shape sharper or bulkier without changing its ordering.|
|Invert Output|Bool|Inverts the output values after processing, flipping low and high values across the midrange.|
|Mix Factor|Float|Mixing factor for blending input and output values. A value of 0 uses only the input, 1 uses only the output, and intermediate values perform a linear interpolation.|
|Mix Method|Enumeration|Method used to combine input and output values. Options include linear interpolation (default), min, max, smooth min, smooth max, add, and subtract.|
|Remap Range|Value range|Linearly remaps the output values to a specified target range (default is [0, 1]).|
|Saturation Range|Value range|Modifies the amplitude of elevations by first clamping them to a given interval and then scaling them so that the restricted interval matches the original input range. This enhances contrast in elevation variations while maintaining overall structure.|
|Smoothing Radius|Float|Defines the radius for post-processing smoothing, determining the size of the neighborhood used to average local values and reduce high-frequency detail. A radius of 0 disables smoothing.|
|radius|Float|No description|
|Seed|Random seed number|Random seed number. The random seed is an offset to the randomized process. A different seed will produce a new result.|
|Weight|Float|Controls how much higher FBM octaves contribute to the noise based on local elevation. A higher weight suppresses high-frequency octaves at low elevations and increases their influence at higher elevations, producing terrain where fine details appear mainly near peaks while lower areas remain smoother.|

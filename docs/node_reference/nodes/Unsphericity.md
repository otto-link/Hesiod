Unsphericity Node
=================


Unsphericity is a measure used to quantify the deviation of the heightmap shape from a perfect sphere. In other words, it indicates how much the terrain differs from being perfectly round or spherical.

# Inputs

|Name|Type|Description|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|input|VirtualArray|Input heightmap.|

# Outputs

|output|VirtualArray|Shape index.|

# Parameters

|Name|Type|Description|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|inverse|Bool|Toggle inversion of the output values.|
|Gain|Float|Mid-centered gain transformation applied to the elevation values. This is a non-linear recurve operator centered around the mid elevation (typically 0.5). Increasing the gain pushes values toward the minimum and maximum elevations, creating flatter low/high regions with a steeper transition around the midpoint.|
|Gamma|Float|Standard gamma correction applied to the elevation values. This is a monotonic power-law remapping that shifts emphasis toward low or high elevations, making the overall shape sharper or bulkier without changing its ordering.|
|Invert Output|Bool|Inverts the output values after processing, flipping low and high values across the midrange.|
|Remap Range|Value range|Linearly remaps the output values to a specified target range (default is [0, 1]).|
|Saturation Range|Value range|Modifies the amplitude of elevations by first clamping them to a given interval and then scaling them so that the restricted interval matches the original input range. This enhances contrast in elevation variations while maintaining overall structure.|
|Smoothing Radius|Float|Defines the radius for post-processing smoothing, determining the size of the neighborhood used to average local values and reduce high-frequency detail. A radius of 0 disables smoothing.|
|radius|Float|Filter radius with respect to the domain size.|
|remap|Bool|Remap the operator's output to a specified range, defaulting to [0, 1].|
|smoothing|Bool|Enable or disable smoothing to reduce noise in the curvature computation.|
|smoothing_radius|Float|Specifies the radius for smoothing, determining how much the curvature is averaged over neighboring pixels.|
